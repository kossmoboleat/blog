This extension is really useful, when you're watching a Youtube video and browsing through the list of videos to watch. "<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/olohkebleofongajeodnhideeiapohgi" title="Google Chrome Extension Store">YtShowRating</a>" allows you to see the ratings of other videos in the list. That way you do not end up with these videos, that do not have anything to do with what you're looking at, but just have a similar name.
