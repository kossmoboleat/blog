Dropbox is testing its camera upload feature right now and you get up to 5GB of storage for testing it. All you have to do is install their latest <a href="http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=53544">beta software</a> connect a camera with up to 4.5 GB of photos and you gain as much storage as you upload plus 0.5 GB just for installing their beta client. When you connect the camera you will be prompted if you want to upload the photos and then as you upload your storage will magically increase.

Well, maybe all this is very unimportant very soon, when Google launches a cloud storage solution called <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970204369404577211961645711988-lMyQjAxMTAyMDAwODEwNDgyWj.html">"G-Drive"</a>. It's supposed to be much cheaper, but if you don't pay for Dropbox, I guess that can't really happen :-). 

<strong>UPDATE:</strong>
If you don't have Dropbox yet you can get it <a href="http://db.tt/dOy2jIot">here</a>.
