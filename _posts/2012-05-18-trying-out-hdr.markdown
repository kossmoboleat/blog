High Dynamic Range (HDR) photos try to capture a higher contrast between the lightest and the darkest parts of a picture (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">wikipedia</a>). You would normally need a special camera for taking HDR pictures, but you can imitate the effect by taking multiple pictures (>=3) with different exposures. Typical consumer cameras have only very recently introduced automated procedures for taking pictures with different exposures. Hackers have retro-fitted this capability to much older compact cameras such as my Canon IXUS 100IS. Using the alternative firmware <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK</a> you can run a script that creates the necessary 3 exposures. (I've blogged about CHDK  and how to install it [before]({% link _posts/2012-02-17-open-source-firmware-for-canon-camera.markdown %})).

So this is the result and it quite impressive in comparison to "reality" :-):
