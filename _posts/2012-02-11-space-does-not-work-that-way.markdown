When you watch films like Star Wars or Star Trek you usually just marvel at the imagination of the creators, but if start thinking about it you realize that it has a couple of weird properties. The one that one strikes me every time I see a SciFi movie is the sounds space crafts make. In a vacuum like space you cannot hear anything. I can understand that a silent space would make many battle scenes utterly boring, so this might be an acceptable break from reality.

This <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay">site </a>has a very big list about common errors in Space movies, like my argument under <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsNoisy">"Space Is Noisy"</a>, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexSpaceSuit">space suits for women</a> and the overall problem that <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">"Science Fiction writers have no sense of scale"</a>.
