C++ was my first real "production" language and my first encounters were really ghastly. Why would anybody use sth. this hard to use with such useless error messages? It just seemed so pointless to write a program that would need a lot of explanation to make itself understood to the user. The video is about Clang which is like a wet programmer dream. You get actual useful error messages and improvement suggestions on how you should change your code. It then continues to give you more error messages assuming that you changed your earlier error. That concept alone is very nice, you can actually use more than the first error message from the compiler. Clang doesn't stop at the usual role of the compiler but even does some static code analysis.
