Last [time]({% link _posts/2012-02-06-great-google-chrome-extensions-wikipedia-beautifier.markdown %}) I wrote about another Google Chrome extensions, that makes the Wikipedia readable. Another great extension I found is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibhgpbllgc" title="chrome extension site">Google Quickscroll</a>. It allows you to directly jump to the search result on a web page. It's extremely useful if you happen to search for technical details that can be found somewhere on a web page that is several screens long. This way you don't have to use the search function and try to be your own little manual search engine by entering your search term _again_ in the search field.
