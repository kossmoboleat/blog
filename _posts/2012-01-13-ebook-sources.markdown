The Singapore national public library offers free accounts to foreigners if they provide their passport number. Their collection of ebooks is very large, although I found it to be lacking many SciFi classics. There's a lot of bestseller stuff though, like Stephen King, John Grisham and also a large collection of non-fiction books:

The University of Adelaide has a large selection of very nicely formatted public domain books:
