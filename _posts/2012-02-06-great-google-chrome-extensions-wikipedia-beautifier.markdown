Most web sites use a very small font by default. For actual reading I tend to increase the font size to make it a little bit more bearable. Unfortunately the trend towards widescreen displays works against readability too. There's a certain number of words you can read comfortably and it's about 20 or so. On Wikipedia you have lots of text and the layout uses the whole screen, which results in abysmal readability. Scott Wheeler created a great extension called "<a href="https://github.com/scotchi/wikipedia-beautifier/wiki/Wikipedia-Beautifier" title="github repository by Scott Wheeler">Wikipedia Beautifier</a>" for Google Chrome that amends this situation. It turns this:
