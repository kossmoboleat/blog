Here's a great short story by hugo-award-winning fantasy author neil gaiman titles <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Short_Stories/I_Cthulhu">I Cthulhu</a> referring to a fictional creature created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu">H. P. Lovecraft</a>. The story is great, but read for yourself:

<blockquote>
Cthulhu, they call me. Great Cthulhu.

Nobody can pronounce it right.

Are you writing this down? Every word? Good. Where shall I start -- mm?

Very well, then. The beginning. Write this down, Whateley.

I was spawned uncounted aeons ago, in the dark mists of Khhaa'yngnaiih (no, of course I don't know how to spell it. Write it as it sounds), of nameless nightmare parents, under a gibbous moon. It wasn't the moon of this planet, of course, it was a real moon. On some nights it filled over half the sky and as it rose you could watch the crimson blood drip and trickle down its bloated face, staining it red, until at its height it bathed the swamps and towers in a gory dead red light.

open culture is a very cool site with a lot of public domain content from movies to audiobooks and eBooks to online courses. Some of my favorites are <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/01/orwells_1984_animal_farm_adapted_to_film.html">Animal Farm</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85C2JnZOY4k">Night of the Living Dead</a>
