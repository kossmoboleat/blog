While researching the open-source firmware for canon compact cameras, I found out that there similar projects for some of the recent new DSLRs from Canon. There's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/400plus/">400plus</a> for the EOS 400D/XTi, which features scripting support and a whole lot more control on the exposure and ISO.

And there's <a href="http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Unified#Downloads">Magic Lantern</a> which supports the 550D/T2i/Kiss X4, 60D and 600D/T3i/Kiss X5 and it has partial support for the 50D, 5D Mark II and 500D/T1i. Magic Lantern also offers more refined exposure control, different methods for focusing, long running timelapse photos, shooting several shots for HDR and motion detection.

I would be very excited to try this, but unfortunately my camera is exactly this one model that was left out from the firmware projects; the EOS 450D. Lucky me, I guess, but now I have another reason to get a new camera body ;-).
