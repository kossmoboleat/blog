I've made a panorama view of my sci-fi book collection. See if you can spot why is not just a simple photo of my bookcase:

![Science Fiction Books Panorama]({{ site.github.url | prepend:site.baseurl }}/images/spherical-300x57.jpg)

Click [here]({{ site.github.url | prepend:site.baseurl }}/images/spherical.jpg) for the high-resolution image.

Achieving this was rather more difficult than expected. I used my Canon EOS 450D on a tripod and moved it parallel to the bookcase. This is one of the differences to panorama where the photographer stays at the same spot. The effect was that the panorama software "hugin", which worked beautifully, assumes that the pictures should be arranged in approximately an arch, e.g. like a rainbow. The other problem with my approach was that when moving the books in the bookcase their angle changed, i.e. before they leaned to the left and then to the right. Considering this I am very happy with the results :-).
